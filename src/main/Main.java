This is a personal project I have made in order to apply the Java SE 8 knowledge accumulated so far using the MVC Design Pattern.
Run the main and login with the username:popescumarcel and the password:12345 or create a new user.
This app manages the patients in a virtual hospital.Patients can be added,deleted.
The app has a login frame,a main frame and a frame taht show all the diseases registered in the DB.
More features will be added.
